# Build log

One entry per work package: what was built, decisions and why, numbers measured.

## P0.1 Repository and tooling

**Built.** uv project (`uv.lock` committed), `src/issuescout/` with the nine packages from SRS Appendix C plus `cli.py` and `settings.py` stubs, `tests/{unit,integration,e2e,security,fixtures}`, `eval/`, `deploy/`, `.github/workflows/`. Ruff (lint + format), mypy strict, pytest, and pre-commit hooks.

**Done-when check.** `uv run pytest` passes the placeholder test, and `scripts/check_precommit_rejects.py` writes a badly formatted file, runs the hooks on it, and requires a non-zero exit (all three hooks fail on it).

**Decisions.**
- Python is pinned to `>=3.12,<3.13` so the lock file and benchmark numbers cannot drift across interpreter minors (phase plan: "pin every dependency version now").
- Pre-commit hooks are `language: system` and call `uv run`, so the hooks use exactly the locked tool versions instead of a second copy pinned in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Trade-off: contributors need uv on PATH.
- `pre-commit` is not in the CLAUDE.md stack list, but P0.1 names it explicitly, so it is added as a dev dependency only.
- mypy runs strict on `src` and `tests` from day one; relaxing later is easier than tightening.
- `.gitignore` already excludes `.env*`, `*.pem`, and local mirrors/caches, ahead of P0.6.

**Environment notes (Windows).** uv's managed-Python install left a dangling minor-version junction; recreated it with `mklink /J`. Windows PowerShell 5.1 `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` writes a BOM that breaks TOML parsing; files are written without a BOM.
